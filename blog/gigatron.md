<h1 style="font-size:32pt">Emulating the Gigatron TTL Microcomputer in MAME</h1>
<p>8/6/2020</p><br />
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Concept</h2>
<p>Basically, I did it because I wanted to use a Gigatron TTL without having to go online. Plus, MAME hasn't really had a machine like this before, so I figured I'd give it a shot. 
The Gigatron is a relatively simple machine, every hardware aspect is controlled by the "CPU", the screen,
sound, blinkenlights, everything.</p><br />
<p>The Gigatron has no CPU, it's all 7400-series TTL logic chips, but those specific chips allow for an instruction set with 256 unique instructions, with a few registers that are able to control 
the video signal, the sound, and blinkenlights.</p>
