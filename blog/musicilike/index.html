				I'm not entirely sure of how I would describe my taste in music. Most of it is "alyrical", as in not having lyrics, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy music that has lyrics.<br/><br/>
				A handful of genres that I enjoy are: Chiptune, Jazz, Dubstep, and Atmospheric, if that really means anything.<br/><br/>
				Music nerds, feel free to roast me on my lack of articulation when it comes to expressing why I like the music I do.<br/><br/>
				Also, this page is not comprehensive, just stuff I really feel like needs mentioning.<br/><br/>
				Anyway, on with all the music.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h2>Albums / Games</h2>
			<h3>Activision Anthology (Game Boy Advance)</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/activanth.jpg"><br/>
			2002 / Alexander Brandon<br/><br/>
			<p>
				This game is a collection of Atari 2600 games and homebrews for the Game Boy Advance, featuring some original 80s-style tracks from Alexander Brandon! Great stuff too, all the synthy harmonies especially in the track "Anthology" are totally in his style, much like what he did for Unreal and Unreal Tournament.<br/><br/>
				All of the music is tracked too, so you can rip it using <a href="https://github.com/lunasorcery/engine-software-gba-tools">lunasorcery's tools</a> and get high quality rips of them!<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: Anthology, Leap<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Hardcore Pinball (Game Boy Advance)</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/hcpin.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2002 / Aleksi Eeben, Hans Van Vilet, Jake Kaufman, Jonne "Purple Motion" Valtone<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A decent variety of tracks in this game, one for each of the four tables: Station, Robomech, Retro, and Soccer.<br/><br/>
				Station is a somewhat atmospheric track, in combination with a table that looks to be about an interdimensional train station.<br/><br/>
				Robomech is this gritty, artificial electronic track, very fitting for table that has the player powering up a large robot.<br/><br/>
				Retro is a jazzy track that uses the GBA direct sound for vocals and drums, and uses the legacy CGB channels for a decent chunk of the melody. Lovely track.<br/><br/>
				Soccer is pretty much exactly that, it's a sporty track that's complete with crowds cheering. It's good, but not my favorite.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: Station, Robomech, Retro<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Portal 2</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/portal2.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2011 / Mike Morasky + Johnathan Coulton and Ellen McLain<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike Morasky has such a way with creating atmospheric, adaptive music. Pretty much the entirety of Portal 2's official soundtrack release is complations of the various stems heard throughout gameplay.<br/><br/>
				Take the track <i>15 Acres of Broken Glass</i>. This is a track that combines the many stems heard in the chamber called "Trust Fling." It starts off with this quiet tapping track, before gradually gaining a lot of noise with stems that the player hears when being launched on the Faith Plate. At first it just sounds like random noise, but then you realise "Oh! There's an actual rhythm to this!" I especially like how some of the stems sound like Mike learned to program the Atari TIA and recorded the notes using Stella.<br/><br/>
				I think the track <i>Adrenal Vapor</i> is a interesting example of minimalism, although it probably wasn't originally made to be listenable on its own. It's still a lovely track in my opinion.<br/><br/>
				If you've played Portal 2, I think you most definitely like this soundtrack as well.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: 9999999, Technical Difficulties, 15 Acres of Broken Glass, <br/>Love as a Construct, Turret Wife Serenade, Comedy Equals Tragedy Plus Time,<br/>The Reunion, TEST, Your Precious Moon, Want You Gone<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Autumntunes</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/autumntunes.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2009 / Various Artists (Distributed by Ubiktune)<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A 2009 collection of chiptunes made by a bunch of artists and released for free by Ubiktune! Not all tracks are my favorite, but with the wide range of genres, there's absolutely something for everyone here.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: Syphus - Drop Table, kulor - Doorbellsplosion,<br/>Joule - Bursting Bubble Boy<br/><br/>

			<h3>NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL KULOR!</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/ntwick.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2012 / kulor<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A chiptune album composed by kulor! They have a talent for creating lovely upbeat jazzy tunes that I'm not sure I can describe. Kulor also greatly demonstrates his ability to compose for a wide range of hardware, from the VRC6, AY-3-8910, SID, and more.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of chiptune and upbeat jazz, please give this one a listen.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: My First LSDJ, Butterscotch Drops of Lime,<br/>Boyfriend and Girlfriend, Space Disko, Nintendo Entertainment Samba,<br/>Snofer's Infiltration Mission, Lobbyists, Electric Starbounce,<br/>Elementary School Supernova, Random Encounter,<br/>Madness Sky Falling Etc, Cruisin' Mah '95 Pimpmobile, I'm No Cyberhero,<br/>Fashion Queen (What I Should've Done the First Time Ubermix)<br/><br/>

			<h3>Poker Night 2</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/pn2.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2013 / Jared Emerson-Johnson<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite Poker game of all time, playing it with "A steroid freak with rage issues. A horny robot. A half-witted cripple. And a dog," (GLaDOS' words, not mine).<br/><br/>
				Much like Telltale's previous works, Jared returns with a collection of Jazz arrangements from The Venture Bros., The Walking Dead, Sam & Max, Army of Darkness, Borderlands, and Portal.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: No Vacancy (The Venture Bros.), Prologue (Army of Darkness), Twilight Eternal (Sam & Max), Dark Rooms (The Walking Dead)<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Petscop Soundtrack</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/petscop.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2019 / Tony "pressedyes" Domineco<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Released on Thanksgiving in 2019 following the conclusion of Petscop, this features high quality versions of all the music and most of the sound effects heard throughout the web series.<br/><br/>
				Tracks can range from very lighthearted to very unnerving, such as <i>level1</i> and <i>school</i> respectively.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: level1, gift-plane, level2, birthday, driving, school, girl-world, explore, bottom<br/><br/>

			<h3>ULTRAKILL</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/uk1.jpg"> <img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/uk2.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				202? / Heaven Pierce Her<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				ULTRAKILL's soundtrack has its moments. All of it is pretty freakin' good hyperpop/breakcore-type beats. I appreciate that there's a slight emphasis on melody over the extreme usage of loud drum samples, it makes it somewhat easier to listen to compared to other breakcore tracks that I've listened to.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: The Fire is Gone, Unstoppable Force, A Shattered Illusion,<br/>Panic Betrayer, The Cyber Grind, Deep Blue, CHAOS<br/><br/>

				The compliation of winners from Battle of the Bits' Winter Chip IX competition.<br/><br/>

			<h3>Soundchip Salad</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/salad.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2018 / kulor<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Another LP from kulor, this time with a focus on variety when it comes to hardware! Six years later, kulor had definitely refined his composing skills and was able to make a much less repetitive set of tracks! There's even a few guest artist appearances!<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: StillPlayingMario.nsf, Our Time Machine Works!, Sample Me Again,<br/>A Stroll in my LeSabre, Big Win Mega Win,<br/>Maxo - Butterscotch Drops of Lime (Maxo Rockmix),<br/>kfaraday - My First Ubiktune Remix, Fearofdark - Cyberhero Disco<br/><br/>

			<h3>Stick Fight: The Game (Original Soundtrack)</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/stfight.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2017 / Karl Flodin<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my friends referred to this album as "zany." They are correct in this observation.<br/><br/>
				The soundtrack to Stick Fight: The Game, and contains a wide arrange of lovely up-beat and wacky electronic mixes.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: Stick It, Sticky Situation, Stuck in the Middle<br/><br/>

			<h3>The Coffee Zone</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/coffee.jpg"><br/>
			<p>
				2014 / Fearofdark<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Fearofdark is such a talented jazz musician. These tracks are just straight up bangers, an absolute must-buy for those who like chiptune.<br/><br/>
				There's such a wide range of tones here, adventurous, nostalgic, emotional, it has it all. Please buy this. Give him money.<br/><br/>
				Favorite tracks: Lovesickness, Scaling the Dragon Fortress, Rain Dance,<br/>Pancake Department, Zoning Residential, Dopefish Lives, Dandelion Ride,<br/>Penguins of the Apocalypse, Flame Repellent, Snow Burn, Fun With Lazer Guns,<br/>The Coffee Zone<br/><br/>

			<h2>Individual tracks</h2>
			<h3>DOOM Eternal: Legacy - The Final Terminus</h3>
			<img width="384px" src="assets/img/blog/musicilike/del.png"><br/>
			<p>
				2021 / SLAD3 & SPC HC (Original by Mick Gordon)<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				DOOM Eternal's official soundtrack mix... wasn't great, but that's a whole can of worms that's not worth discussing.<br/><br/>
				Anyway, in 2021 a couple of YouTube users took it upon themselves to rip the entirety of all the stems in the game and re-mix them into something a lot more listenable, and the results I think are fantastic.<br/><br/>
				This one is my favorite track, a mix of the track "DOOM Hunted," played in the DOOM Hunter base.<br/><br/>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Djzbatrc0&list=PLAwkDjVcJePjpk91j4X-sZozhfetnGFF2">Link to YouTube Playlist</a><br/><br/>

			<p>
				2003 / luchibobra<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Created as part of a 2003 ZX Spectrum Demo for CAFe'2003. This is a track that I spent the better part of five years looking for until my friend Tobach asked around for where it came from. I first heard it in the "simplelight" theme for Recalbox around late 2018.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Meteora - Don't Stay</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oWfGOVWrueo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				2001 / Linkin Park<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				I first heard this track in a mod for Yakuza Kiwami 2 called <i>The Silly Mod</i>, which turns the game into a giant shitpost.<br/><br/>
				Probably the only Linkin Park track that I like so far, especially goes well with the Ryuji Goda fight in that game.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Roots of Ruin</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8LSxLYGpGA8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				2024 / Rei8bit<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A hyperpop boss fight track using the Ricoh N2A03, Namco N-163, and Nintendo FDS.<br/><br/>
				This track won 4th place out of 348 entries in Winter Chip XIX!<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Different Ways</h3>

			<p>
				2005 / AceMan<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A lovely calming XM track. Not much more to say, I just really freakin' like it.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Jazz Jackrabbit 2 - Dark Groove</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2UkcYTGWyZE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				1998 / Alexander Brandon<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Another appearance of Alexander Brandon on this list, this time for Jazz 2!<br/><br/>
				Really like listening to this one on long road trips. It's very fitting for staring at empty highways.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Nyakuza Manholes</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GDxS8oK6hCc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				2019 / nelward<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				An absolutely bangin' funky jazz track, played in the Nyakuza Manholes in A Hat in Time!<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>View-Monster - Modify</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5whfnP4Vd3s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				2008 / Neil Cicierega<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A funky electronic track with some messed up & cynical lyrics. Possibly a satire from the perspective of a corporate entity that profits greatly from careless body-modding.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h3>Like a Dragon Gaiden - Bring It On</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/14xdi88vHoA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				2023 / Keitarou Hanada<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite track from Gaiden, one that's just pure anger against the idiots that try to beat you up over in Shofukucho, the Daidoji, or anyone else that thinks they can even remotely touch you.<br/><br/> 
			</p>
			<h3>Yakuza Kiwami - Renewed Unrest</h3>
			<iframe width="384px" height="216px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GbwFYg8Koao" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				2016 / SEGA SOUND TEAM<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				A really, really ominous track. I can hear this one pretty much every time I leave a building before I have a school exam. This song is really good at setting the tone for "things are about to hit the fan."<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
