<h1 style="font-size:32pt">Tales from the Computery Nonsense folder</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">?/?/202?</h2>
<p>This page kinda serves as me rambling on about things that happened on Scratch and other computery tomfoolery that I did when I was really young.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Specs of Machine #1</h2>
<p>Dell Dimension 4550</p>
<p>Intel Northwood Pentium 4 SL6S2 @2524 MHz x86, supporting MMX, SSE, and SSE2, 478-pin FC-PGA2, 512K of L2 cache, OEM. <a href="https://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/SL/SL6S2.html">CPU-World Page</a></p>
<p>1 GB of RAM</p>
<p>60 GB hard disk space</p>
<p>250 GB Secondary drive</p>
<p>Windows XP Professional 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3 Build 2600</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce 6200</p>
<p>SoundBlaster Audigy 2 ZS</p>
<p>and an outdated version of Firefox</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was my primary machine up to late 2014, and it definitely was not good for flash programs.</p>
<p>Eventually I used a 32-bit Linux distribution running off of a USB drive to make a complete backup of the 60 GB drive, which took around 12 hours to complete, finishing at around 2:20 AM. That image was eventually copied to a home server, taking ANOTHER 12 hours, where it resides to this day.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">BeyBlade</h2>
<p>One of the earlier games I played on that machine was that online BeyBlade game by Hasbro. LOL remember BeyBlades??</p>
<p>It's a small footnote, just deserved to be mentioned.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">Fisher-Price EasyLink</h2>
<p>This was when I was <i>really</i> young. My mother had bought me a Fisher-Price EasyLink, which was this children's toy that connected to a Windows PC, this machine be a Windows XP laptop from Dell.</p>
<p>This toy had a bunch of figurines of Disney PlayHouse and PBS Kids characters, such as Arthur, Elmo, or Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>I don't remember many details about the software, I'm going off of what I remember.</p>
<p>So, what I believed happened was there was this sort of hub that the parent would launch that a child couldn't escape with ease. The child would place one of the figures onto the green slot, reading what I think was an NFC tag or similar. The hub software would then either open a browser to play the associated game, or it had a built-in version of Adobe Flash in order to play these games.</p>
<p>I only remember one game being played on it, and that was the Arthur game, titled <i>Alien: Assembly Required</i>.</p>
<p>It's like a very primitive version of Nintendo's amiibo.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should track one down and mess with it one day.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">Dig Dug on Fupa</h2>
<p>When I was much younger, I played a lot of Dig Dug on Xbox Live Arcade, and eventually, I convinced my mother to find a version on the internet.</p>
<p>It was on a site called "Fupa."</p>
<p>Only recently did I realize that version was the Nintendo Game Boy version running in a Flash-based emulator named <i>PlayR</i>.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">ChromaDepth 3D</h2>
<p>The Nintendo 3DS is what kickstarted the obsession with 3D that eight-year-old me had. After that. At some point, my mother found some glasses that gave the illusion of 3D depending on the color.</p>
<p>Like, the depth of the object depended on the color of it, it was <i>super</i> cool. To this day it's still kinda cool.</p>
<p>I also hung up 3D anaglyph Minecraft screenshots all around my room. Ha.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Beginning of Scratch</h2>
<p>I first started Scratch in late July (I think it was 28?) of 2014, when I was 10 years old. My mother had just bought me a book called <i>Help Your Kids With Computer Coding</i>. I had always wanted to make games of my own but never knew where to start.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was copy the project <a href="https://sterophonick.github.io/Archive/ScratchGames/MonkeyMayhem"><i>Monkey Mayhem</i></a>.</p>
<p>Every day I would make changes to it and some friends from school would play it and think it was cool.</p>
<p>Eventually this escalated to me using Scratch for school projects, but that's getting a little ahead of ourselves.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Disappearing Data Bug</h2>
<p>Ah yes, finally an explanation for why my Monkey Mayhem description is this:</p>
<img src="..\images\blog\talesfromscratch\mmdesc.png"><br/>
<p>Essentially what happened was whenever I made a change to that project, the secondary costume for the Monkey would be completely deleted.</p>
<p>I eventually made a forum thread about this, entitled <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/49002/"><i>Missing Costumes?</i></a></p>
<p>The users on there basically told me that Firefox has problems with Scratch and that the Scratch Team was working on it.</p>
<br/>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The engoodening of eggman15</h2>
<p>Basically I found this project and wanted to help the user who went by eggman15.</p>
<p>You can find the beginning of the remix chain <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18296042">here.</a></p>
<br/>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">Super Block Jump and Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Oh boy. Literally the first 20 or so stages were ripped directly from another Scratch game called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24495248/">Mustache Kitty.</a></p>
<p>Literally that's what the first few prototypes were. Just a clone of Mustache Kitty.</p>
<p>I eventually made more original levels, but what do you want of me, I was 10.</p>

<img src="..\images\blog\talesfromscratch\mustache3.png"><img src="..\images\blog\talesfromscratch\sbj3.png"><br/>
<p>Even the physics engine was copied verbatim. And the Game Boy Advance port used that script as a reference!</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Specs of Machine #2</h2>
<p>Lenovo ThinkPad T410</p>
<p>Intel Core i5-520M @2.4GHz</p>
<p>4 GB RAM (later upgraded to 6, then 8)</p>
<p>NVIDIA NVS 3100M</p>
<p>250GB HDD, later upgraded to 500GB then 1TB because of hard drive failures lol</p>
<p>Windows 7, later upgraded to Windows 10</p>
<br/>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">Super Block Jump Wiki</h2>
<p>Yeah, that happened. Not much of it survives today except for very few screenshots and a <i>very</i> incomplete Wayback Machine crawl, which is probably for the better.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Forest Cafe or something</h2>
<p>In 6th grade Social Studies, we had a project where we had to design a restaurant. We were to make a drawing and a menu, and I chose to make the drawing in Microsoft 3D builder.</p>
<p>This was back in January of 2016, and I had next to no experience in 3D modelling.</p>
<p>What ended up happening was I made the entire building out of cubes</p>
<p>By the end, there were so many cubes that my NVS 3100M struggled to render it, there was render clipping and Z-Fighting all over it.</p>
<p>The file no longer survives, but I still have screenshots.</p>
