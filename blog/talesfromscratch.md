<h1 style="font-size:32pt">Tales from Scratch and Other Nonsense</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">?/?/202?</h2>
<p>This page kinda serves as me rambling on about things that happened on Scratch and other computery tomfoolery that I did when I was really young.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Beginning</h2>
<p>I first started Scratch in late July (I think it was 28?) of 2014, when I was 10 years old. My mother had just bought me a book called <i>Help Your Kids With Computer Coding</i>. I had always wanted to make games of my own but never knew where to start.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was copy the project <a href="https://sterophonick.github.io/Archive/ScratchGames/MonkeyMayhem"><i>Monkey Mayhem</i></a>.</p>
<p>Every day I would make changes to it and some friends from school would play it and think it was cool.</p>
<p>Eventually this escalated to me using Scratch for school projects, but that's getting a little ahead of ourselves.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Specs of the Machine</h2>
<p>Dell Dimension 4550</p>
<p>Intel Northwood Pentium 4 @2524 MHz x86, supporting MMX, SSE, and SSE2</p>
<p>1 GB of RAM</p>
<p>60 GB hard disk space</p>
<p>Windows XP Professional 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3 Build 2600</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce 6200</p>
<p>and an outdated version of Firefox</p>
<br />
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Disappearing Data Bug</h2>
<p>Ah yes, finally an explanation for why my Monkey Mayhem description is this:</p>
<img src="..\images\blog\talesfromscratch\mmdesc.png"><br/>
<p>Essentially what happened was whenever I made a change to that project, the secondary costume for the Monkey would be completely deleted.</p>
<p>I eventually made a forum thread about this, entitled <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/49002/"><i>Missing Costumes?</i></a></p>
<p>The users on there basically told me that Firefox has problems with Scratch and that the Scratch Team was working on it.</p>
<br/>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The engoodening of eggman15</h2>
<p>Basically I found this project and wanted to help the user who went by eggman15.</p>
<p>You can find the beginning of the remix chain <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18296042">here.</a></p>
<br/>
<h2 style="font-size:28pt">Super Block Jump and Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Oh boy. Literally the first 20 or so stages were ripped directly from another Scratch game called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24495248/">Mustache Kitty.</a></p>
<p>Literally that's what the first few prototypes were. Just a clone of Mustache Kitty.</p>
<p>I eventually made more original levels, but what do you want of me, I was 10.</p>

<img src="..\images\blog\talesfromscratch\mustache3.png"><img src="..\images\blog\talesfromscratch\sbj3.png"><br/>
<p>Even the physics engine was copied verbatim. And the Game Boy Advance port used that script as a reference!<p/>
