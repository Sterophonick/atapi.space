<h2 style="font-size:28pt">The Beginning</h2>
<p>I first started Scratch in late July (I think it was 28?) of 2014, when I was 10 years old. My mother had just bought me a book called <i>Help Your Kids With Computer Coding</i>. I had always wanted to make games of my own but never knew where to start.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was copy the project <i>Monkey Mayhem</i>.</p>
<p>Every day I would make changes to it and some friends from school would play it and think it was cool.</p>
<p>Eventually this escalated to me using Scratch for school projects, but that's getting a little ahead of ourselves.</p>
