				folder</h1>
			<h2>Last modified: 09212024</h2>
			<p>This page kinda serves as me rambling on about things that happened on Scratch and other computery
				tomfoolery that I did when I was really young.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>The Specs of Machine #1</h2>
			<p>Dell Dimension 4550</p>
			<p>Intel Northwood Pentium 4 SL6S2 @2524 MHz <a
					href="https://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/SL/SL6S2.html">(CPU-World Page)</a></p>
			<p>1 GB of RAM</p>
			<p>60 GB hard disk space</p>
			<p>250 GB Secondary drive</p>
			<p>Windows XP Professional 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3 Build 2600</p>
			<p>NVIDIA GeForce 6200</p>
			<p>SoundBlaster Audigy 2 ZS</p>
			<p>and an outdated version of Firefox</p>
			<p>The machine's nickname was SNOOPY.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>This was my primary machine up to late 2014, and it definitely was not good for flash programs.</p>
			<p>Eventually I used a 32-bit Linux distribution running off of a USB drive to make a complete backup of the
				60 GB drive, which took around 12 hours to complete, finishing at around 2:20 AM. That image was
				eventually copied to a home server, taking ANOTHER 12 hours, where it resides to this day.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>BeyBlade</h2>
			<p>One of the earlier games I played on that machine was that online BeyBlade game by Hasbro. Remember
				BeyBlades?? <img src="assets/img/smileys/rofl.gif"></p>
			<p>It's a small footnote, just deserved to be mentioned.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Fisher-Price EasyLink</h2>
			<p>This was when I was <i>really</i> young. My mother had bought me a Fisher-Price EasyLink, which was this
				children's toy that connected to a Windows PC, this machine be a Windows XP laptop from Dell.</p>
			<p>This toy had a bunch of figurines of Disney PlayHouse and PBS Kids characters, such as Arthur, Elmo, or
				Mickey Mouse.</p>
			<p>I don't remember many details about the software, I'm going off of what I remember.</p>
			<p>So, what I believed happened was there was this sort of hub that the parent would launch that a child
				couldn't escape with ease. The child would place one of the figures onto the green slot, reading what I
				think was an NFC tag or similar. The hub software would then either open a browser to play the
				associated game, or it had a built-in version of Adobe Flash in order to play these games.</p>
			<p>I only remember one game being played on it, and that was the Arthur game, titled <i>Alien: Assembly
					Required</i>.</p>
			<p>It's like a very primitive version of Nintendo's amiibo.</p>
			<p>Perhaps I should track one down and mess with it one day.</p>

			<br />
			<h2>Dig Dug on Fupa</h2>
			<p>When I was much younger, I played a lot of Dig Dug on Xbox Live Arcade, and eventually, I convinced my
				mother to find a version on the internet.</p>
			<p>It was on a site called "Fupa."</p>
			<p>Only recently did I realize that version was the Nintendo Game Boy version running in a Flash-based
				emulator named <i>PlayR</i>.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>ChromaDepth 3D</h2>
			<p>The Nintendo 3DS is what kickstarted the obsession with 3D that eight-year-old me had. After that. At
				some point, my mother found some glasses that gave the illusion of 3D depending on the color.</p>
			<p>Like, the depth of the object depended on the color of it, it was <i>super</i> cool. To this day it's
				still kinda cool.</p>
			<p>I also hung up 3D anaglyph Minecraft screenshots all around my room. Ha.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>The Beginning of Scratch</h2>
			<p>I first started Scratch in late July (I think it was 28?) of 2014, when I was 10 years old. My mother had
				just bought me a book called <i>Help Your Kids With Computer Coding</i>. I had always wanted to make
				games of my own but never knew where to start.</p>
			<p>The first thing I did was copy the project <a
					href="https://sterophonick.github.io/Archive/ScratchGames/MonkeyMayhem"><i>Monkey Mayhem</i></a>.
			</p>
			<p>Every day I would make changes to it and some friends from school would play it and think it was cool.
			</p>
			<p>Eventually this escalated to me using Scratch for school projects, but that's getting a little ahead of
				ourselves.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>The Disappearing Data Bug</h2>
			<p>Ah yes, finally an explanation for why my Monkey Mayhem description is this:</p>
			<img src="assets\img\blog\talesfromscratch\mmdesc.png"><br />
			<p>Essentially what happened was whenever I made a change to that project, the secondary costume for the
				Monkey would be completely deleted.</p>
			<p>I eventually made a forum thread about this, entitled <a
					href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/49002/"><i>Missing Costumes?</i></a></p>
			<p>The users on there basically told me that Firefox has problems with Scratch and that the Scratch Team was
				working on it.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>The engoodening of eggman15</h2>
			<p>Basically I found this project and wanted to help the user who went by eggman15.</p>
			<p>You can find the beginning of the remix chain <a
					href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18296042">here.</a></p>
			<br />
			<h2>Super Block Jump and Plagiarism</h2>
			<p>Oh boy. Literally the first 20 or so stages were ripped directly from another Scratch game called <a
					href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24495248/">Mustache Kitty.</a></p>
			<p>Literally that's what the first few prototypes were. Just a clone of Mustache Kitty.</p>
			<p>I eventually made more original levels, but what do you want of me, I was 10.</p>

				src="assets\img\blog\talesfromscratch\sbj3.png"><br />
			<p>Even the physics engine was copied verbatim. And the Game Boy Advance port used that script as a
				reference!</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>The Specs of Machine #2</h2>
			<p>Lenovo ThinkPad T410</p>
			<p>Intel Core i5-520M @2.4GHz</p>
			<p>4 GB RAM (later upgraded to 6, then 8)</p>
			<p>NVIDIA NVS 3100M</p>
			<p>250GB HDD, later upgraded to 500GB then 1TB because of hard drive failures <img
					src="assets/img/smileys/rofl.gif"></p>
			<p>Windows 7, later upgraded to Windows 10</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Super Block Jump Wiki</h2>
			<p>Yeah, that happened. Not much of it survives today except for very few screenshots and a <i>very</i>
				incomplete Wayback Machine crawl, which is probably for the better.</p>

			<h2>The Forest Cafe or something</h2>
			<p>In 6th grade Social Studies, we had a project where we had to design a restaurant. We were to make a
				drawing and a menu, and I chose to make the drawing in Microsoft 3D builder.</p>
			<p>This was back in January of 2016, and I had next to no experience in 3D modelling.</p>
			<p>What ended up happening was I made the entire building out of cubes</p>
			<p>By the end, there were so many cubes that my NVS 3100M struggled to render it, there were opject priority
				issues and Z-Fighting all over it.</p>
			<p>The file no longer survives, but I still have screenshots.</p>

			<h2>Nesbox Emulator (UWP)</h2>
			<p>Back in early 2016, I did some experiments in emulation. More specifically, Game Boy emulation through
				Nesbox Emulator that was on the Microsoft Store at one point.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, I know that Nesbox Emulator is <i>hot garbage</i> but what can I say, I didn't know very much.
			</p>
			<p>I played games from 5 or so years before such as Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World, Hardcore
				Pinball, and Franklin's Great Adventures.</p>
			<p>In fact, around the same time, there was an influx of classmates installing emulators on their
				Chromebooks, there were some available through the Chrome Web Store.</p>
			<p>Funny story, so my teacher in one class, was watching me play Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island, and
				then asked me, "Where do you get these games?"</P>
			<p>I kinda hesitated for a minute and said "I don't know."</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Zorin Linux, Wine, and Tag: The Power of Paint</h2>
			<p>When I was 10 or so, I often played a little PC game called Tag: The Power of Paint. It released in 2008
				and laid the groundwork for the gels in Portal 2.</p>
			<p>I had a "copy" of it on a USB drive that I took to school</p>
			<p>At school, we had these HP Mini 5102 (they might've been 5103s but whatevs) netbooks that ran Zorin OS, a
				flavor of Ubuntu Linux designed around emulating the Windows UI/UX.
			<p>
			<p>I was in math class and when I was done with all my work for that class I tried to play Tag on one of
				them.</p>
			<p>Keyword being <i>tried.</i></p>
			<p>But at that time, I didn't that the concept of appication binary interfaces (ABIs) and I didn't know what
				the crap Wine was, much less how to use it.
			<p>
			<p>And that "copy" of Tag was really just a .lnk file copied from the desktop on my T410 and nothing else.

			<h2>EZ-Flash IV Haribo</h2>
			<p>This photo, taken on June 16, 2017, is something that I thought I had lost forever, but no actually, I've
				had it this whole time. It's a photo of when I first got my EZ-Flash IV, and the vendor on Amazon that
				we bought it from also shipped us a little packet of Haribo gummy bears for some reason. The cartridge
				didn't come in an EZ-Flash branded box, just a little cardboard sleeve with the cartrdige, the bears,
				and the microSD reader.</p>
			<p>And yes, the bears were pretty okay. I remember them being a tad stale though, but that could just be a
				fuzzy memory speaking.</p>

			<br />
			<h2>The Screwed Up Frontlight</h2>
			<p>I first frontlit my Game Boy Advance not too long after I got the EZ-Flash IV. I was terrible at it. My
				mom also insisted that we leave the entire unit soldered together on the old concrete wall as it cured,
				and I was anxious it was going to blow away as it was rather windy that day. I ended up getting a little
				bit of the LOCA on the front of the plastic panel, and I spent a good deal trying to goo-gone it off. I
				think that only made things worse, as the goo gone might have seeped into the sides of the
				screen-frontlight sandwhich and started eating away at the LOCA, causing a the most dramatic spidering
				effect I've ever seen. It even led up to the plastic becoming brittle and pieces were breaking off of
				it.</p>
			<p>Later on, I swapped out the screen with an AGS-001 screen and later, an AGS-101 panel.<br />
