				Heh, the lives we lead, huh?<br/>
				Look, shit sucks, and this post isn't to pretend that it doesn't.<br/><br/>

				The fascists, for many years now, have been empowered to call for our extermination, while the liberal so-called "left" repeatedly throws us under the bus for failing to attract an audience because they're too busy bowing their capitalist donors. I get it.<br/><br/>

				Paralyzing, is it not? So many rights and freedoms people fought and died for over the course of decades, centuries even. Eroded just like that, worldwide.<br/><br/>

				It's a vicious cycle, you know. But then again, most things in life are.<br/>
				The pendulum swings one way, then it swings the other.<br/><br/>

				I don't have the foresight to know if we are in a turning point of sorts. My father always says "The more things change, the more things stay the same," but I'm not sure how true that rings here. I mean, the fascists largely got what they want with the results of the 2024 US election, did they not?<br/><br/>

				Eh, hell if I know. They're all still endlessly whining about literally everything they can imagine, compounded by being abandoned by their families AND having that "oh shit" feeling sink in after they realize the tariffs and deportations will also affect <i>them</i>.<br/><br/>

				Regardless, while I can't give everyone a pat on the head and say "Everything will be okay," I can offer a few words of wisdom.<br/><br/>
				First and foremost: you cannot kill yourself.<br/>
				<img width="512px"src="/assets/img/blog/state-of-the-union/no-suicide.png"><br/><br/>

				If you kill yourself, you've given them exactly what they want.<br/><br/>

				With that out of the way, I offer you an interesting concept: doing something purely for fun is a radical concept. The action of doing something <i>purely</i> to create positivity and bring more goodness into the world. Most of the reason I make this website is for fun, and the rest is to have a convenient place for a "persona's portfolio," if that makes any sense. I play video games for fun, and am very much looking forward to playing <i>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</i> with my dad. While video games, and, well, <i>most media</i> are products of capitalism, that doesn't mean they cannot provide a source of joy, motivation, or food for thought.<br/><br/>

				On the flipside, I think that the inverse of this would be the pursuit of harm. I'm not sure if there's a greater evil than this. Not to mention, it's just an unhappy way to live. You see how fascists on social media have literally nothing to be happy about, their hate makes them incapable of enjoying things, they must always find something to complain about or a group of people to harass. Billionaires, for as much wealth and capital that they have accumulated, are some of the most miserable people I've ever seen. Cutting any corner imaginalbe just to save a few bucks in the long run at the expense of peoples' lives or the value of a product. This institution of greed must be destroyed.<br/><br/>
