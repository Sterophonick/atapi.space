				<h1>OneShot Complete Fix for Linux & Steam Deck</h1>
				<img src="assets/img/projects/misc/oneshot_linux.png" width="720px" title="on little cat feet!"><br />
				<p>An all-in-one fix for OneShot to be playable on Linux and Steam Deck!</p
				<p>This package fixes:<br/>
					- Startup crashes due to libstdc++<br/>
					- Startup crashes due to Mesa<br/>
					- Consistent hang towards the end that inhibits all progress<br/>
					- Broken ending sequence tools<br/>
				</p>
				<p>Notes:<br/>
					- If you're on KDE Plasma or Steam Deck, make sure that user applications cannot disable compositing.<br/>
					- I have not tested this on Wayland. Play this way at your own risk.<br/>
					- Steam Deck users, you need to run this through the <a href="https://github.com/Scrumplex/Steam-Play-None">Steam-Play-None</a> compatibility tool, as Steam Linux Runtime messes with this game a bit. This will be auto-installed when the setup script is run, just change your Steam Play compatibility settings in OneShot's properties.<br/>
					- Steam Deck users, do not play this in Game Mode. This game is ideally played in Desktop mode. Configure your controllers accordingly.<br/>
					- This package DOES NOT distribute assets that are not publicly available. You need to buy the Steam release of OneShot to use this package.<br/>
					- DO NOT USE PROTON!<br/>
				<p>Credits:<br/>
					- Main executable built with <a href="https://github.com/thehatkid/ModShot-mkxp-z">ModShot-mkxp</a>.<br/>
					- Journal built with the original <a href="https://github.com/elizagamedev/mkxp-oneshot">mkxp-oneshot</a> repository.<br/>
					- This package contains a build of <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby 3.0.5</a>.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>Bug(s):<br/>
					- The film puzzle is immediately solved for you :/<br/>
				</p>
				<p>Installation:<br/>
					- Extract the contents of the .7z to your game folder.<br/>
					- Execute the setup.sh script.<br/>
					- You're done!<br/>
