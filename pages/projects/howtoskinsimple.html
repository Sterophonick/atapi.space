					<h3 id="Installation">Installation</h3>
					<p>Installing devkitPro will give you access to a suite of tools such as GCC that will allow you to compile the source code of the kernel into a functioning binary that can be applied to your flashcart.</p>
					<p>First, go to the <a href="https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases">devkitPro releases page</a> and download the "devkitProUpdater-3.0.3.exe" executable.</p>
					<p>Once you run it (and satisfy Windows UAC),  you will be greeted with a screen that looks something like this:</p>
					<img src="../../assets/img/projects/gba/simple/guide_1.png">
					<p>Click next, and select "Download and install/install from downloaded files," then, hit next again.</p>
					<img src="../../assets/img/projects/gba/simple/guide_2.png">
					<p>The "Keep downloaded files after install?" option is your choice. I would recommend removing the downloaded files to save space.</p>
					<p>Coming up next, we will see a screen that looks like this:</p>
					<img src="../../assets/img/projects/gba/simple/guide_3.png">
					<p>Here, you'll notice that I have unchecked everything except for "GBA Development."<br/>We are only concerned about the Game Boy Advance here, but if you want to enable things like GameCube or 3DS development, go ahead.</p>
					<p>Up next, you'll be asked where you want to put the devkitPro installation.</p>
					<img src="../../assets/img/projects/gba/simple/guide_4.png">
					<p>I always opt for "C:\devkitPro" but you can put it wherever you want, but make a note of where you put it, it's important.</p>
					<p>Create a Start Menu folder named "devkitPro" and hit "Install."</p>
					<p>And now, watch as it does its magic.</p>

					<p>After it's completed, hit next, and you'll be asked if you want to donate to devkitPro.<br/>...please do!</p>
