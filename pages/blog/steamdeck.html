				<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
				<p>I've owned a good number of handhelds in my time. I had a Game Boy Advance SP when I was a little one, and a PSP, but I think the one I spent the most time with was the Nintendo 3DS family, especially from 2012-2015 or so.</p>
				<p>It wasn't until around early 2019 that I got into PC gaming, when I was gifted this little Dell Optiplex 9020M weilding an Intel HD 4400. I first installed Ubuntu Linux on it but then I realized the potential that it had for some relateively light PC gaming, being more powerful than my laptop at the time, weilding an NVIDIA NVS 3100M.</p>
				<p>That machine was super small and portable despite not being a laptop. I had this cardboard box that could carry it along with a keyboard, a mouse, some Wii Remotes, some gamepads, and all the cables I needed!</p>
				<img style="width:768px" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/cardboardbox.jpg"><br/>
				<p>I would bring it to school during special events or take it to my grandparents' house to play Duck Game, Super Smash Bros. Brawl or Stick Fight with my cousins and stuff, it was great!</p>
				<p>I kept this act up with my 10510U laptop, just now everything was in my backpack and everything was pretty alright, not perfect, but it did the job.</p>
				<p>HOWEVER, this had the side effect of making the machine look like it was practically on life support with the amount of cables I had to attach so that I could get four gamepads to attach since my Bluetooth was so spotty.</p>
				<p>And to top it all off, the laptop, despite being more powerful than the Optiplex, still wasn't made for gaming in the first place, and as such suffered from my worst enemy. Intel's integrated GPUs. *Dramatic riff*</p>
				<p>For a machine made in 2019, you'd think the Intel GPU would be from their Iris family, but nope, we have Comet Lake. Ouch.</p>
				<p>To be fair, the machine did pretty alright with what I threw at it, I played sixty hours of DOOM Eternal on it, but after switching to Linux, certain games just became completely inaccessible.</p>
				<p>To top it all off, Intel's Windows drivers breaking DOOM Eternal and ParaLLEl N64, and their Linux drivers having quite a performance cut, I was ready to move on.</p>
				<p>Enter, the Steam Deck, Valve's funny little ultra-portable gaming PC, running a distro based on Arch Linux and with a purpose-built mobile gaming APU by AMD.</p>
				<p>At the time, I was looking around for a gaming laptop to specifically to use with Linux and when this got announced those plans completely went out of the window.</p>
				<p>I was wanting something really portable to keep up the whole backpack thing but then this gets announced and it kinda shook the plans that I had.</p>
				<p>Fast forward to a year later and I actually have the device in my hands (for three weeks as I write this), let's talk about it!</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Performance</h2>
				<p>The performance is the star of the show with the Steam Deck, with its custom APU touting four AMD Zen 2 x86_64 cores, and eight RDNA 2 Compute Units (CUs).</p>
				<p>But funny numbers like this can only say so much, what about in practice?<br/>
				<p>
				(All Screenshots were taken when docked).<br/>
				DOOM Eternal (Medium Settings, 1600x900)<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/doomEternal.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				Control Ultimate Edition (Low Settings + SSAO, 1280x720)<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/ControlUE.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered (Medium Settings, FSR 2.1, 1280x720, 30FPS Cap)<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/holyCrapSpoderman.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				Stray (Low Settings, High Textures, 80% Scale, 1920x1080, 30FPS Cap)<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/kittyKat.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				A Hat in Time (Custom Low/Medium Settings, 720p)<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/ahit.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition (Highest Settings, 1080p)<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/batmanAA.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				Nearly perfect GameCube and Wii emulation<br/>
				<img class="deckPreview" src="assets/img/blog/steamdeck/wiiEmu.jpg"></a><br/>
				<br/>
				<p>Essentially, most games will run fine out of the box, but much more intensive titles will <i>really</i> need some tweaking to get good performance.</p>
				<p>This machine shines the brightest with AAA games from around 2017 and before. DOOM Eternal cheats because it's so optimized.<br/>On the indie side, basically every indie title that releases in the history of ever will run without issue on this.</p>
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Software</h2>
				<p>SteamOS 3 is... interesting to say the least.</p>
				<p>It's based on a snapshot of Arch Linux with glibc v2.33 and a heavy fork of kernel 5.13. There are two rootfs partitions, and they by default are read-only. They function in this A/B style where when one is running and the OS is updated, the other will be overwritten. This also allows one partition to be a fallback if the other fails to boot.</p>
				<p>The package manager has its own set of SteamOS-specific packages on Valve's own servers.</p>
				<p>As for the firmware, its BIOS is UEFI compliant, but not capable of legacy boot.</p>
				<p>You can install Windows, and I have Windows 10 installed on a small 40GB partition specifically for Xbox 360 emulation.</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Gaming</h2>
				<p>Gaming on the machine is, quite simply, incredible.</p>
				<p>Valve seems to have proven that the PC is fully capable of being an accessible gaming platform if you just give it a little tender love and care.</p>
				<p>The vast majority of games work just fine right out of the box, and those that don't are more often than not fixable with a bit of tinkering.</p>
				<p>
				<h2>Game Problems</h2>
				 - HROT: Poor performance.</br>
				 - Assassin's Creed: Always reads the last controller port, annoying when docked.<br/>
				 - F.E.A.R.: Non-functional gamepad support. Worked around with a keyboard config, worked great.<br/>
				 - Crysis (Original): Crashes because it assumes we can use 3DNow! instructions. Use C1-Launcher.<br/>
				 - American McGee's Alice (2011): Does not accept high resolutions in config files, menu is wonky until Alt-Enter is hit.<br/>
				 - DOOM (2016): Occasional crashes.<br/>
				 - Star Wars: The Force Unleashed: Jittery lava in level 2.<br/>
				 - Various (Native): Controller doubling because it doesn't use SDL2 and Steam doesn't chmod 000 the real devices. (Example: DUSK)<br/>
				 - Various: Resolution doesn't automatically adapt to highest available. (Example: The Simpsons: Hit & Run)<br/>
				 - Various Games: Doesn't accept mouse and gamepad input, limiting gyro (Example: BioShock Remastered).<br/>
