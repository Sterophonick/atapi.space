				NOTE: This game does not work as well as it used to when Scratch 2.0 was around. This is because Scratch 3.0 broke games that exploited certain rounding quirks of Flash.</br>
				To say that this game was broken before would be an understatement.<br/>
				As such, it is not recommended to play this game in Scratch 3.0.<br/>
				You can acquire the Scratch 2 Offline Editor for Windows <a href="../../misc.html">here.</a></br>
