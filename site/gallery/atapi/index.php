<h1>Who is Atapi?</h1>
<p>atapi is little anthropormorphic cat, my fursona</p>
<p>name comes from ATA Packet Interface</p>
<p>he doesnt have much lore because he is supposed to represent me</p>
<p>he is a white cat, a little bit of floof, with red and blue stripes on his ears, torso, legs, and tail
</p>
<p>he can be usually seen wearing a blue hat with a 6502 chip on it, a red sweatshirt with the zipper
undone, and blue shorts</p>
<p>most of the art in the gallery has pikachu-like ears but those were made before the design was finalized
</p>
<p>rest assured, the ears are cat ears</p>
