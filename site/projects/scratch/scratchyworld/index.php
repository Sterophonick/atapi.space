<h1><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="\assets\img\projects\scratch-icon.png"> Scratchy World</h1>
<p>
NOTE: This game does not work as well as it used to when Scratch 2.0 was around. This is because Scratch
3.0 broke games that exploited certain rounding quirks of Flash.</br>
To say that this game was broken before would be an understatement.<br />
As such, it is not recommended to play this game in Scratch 3.0.<br />
You can acquire the Scratch 2 Offline Editor for Windows <a href="/dumps/">here.</a></br>
