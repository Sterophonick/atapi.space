<h2>Game (That I played) of the Year</h2>
<p>
Yakuza 0. I played this game at the very beginning of the year, and its heartfelt, emotonal story combined with the batshit insane combat and substories gave me this stupid smile pretty much throughout the whole game. Highly recommended for people who like beat-em-ups and story-driven games.<br/>
<img width="768px" src="/assets/img/blog/2024inreview/yakuza.jpg"><br/><br/>

<h2>Game (That I Want to Play) of the Year</h2>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle<br/>
Made by MachineGames and running on idTech, this game appears to be a lovely mishmash of The Chronicles of Riddick, Dishonored, Uncharted, and Wolfenstein. It creates an entire new story rather than just re-using the story of Raiders of the Lost Ark or something, and looks like a fun game to play with my dad, we both hate fascists and love Indiana Jones. :3<br/>
<img width="768px" src="/assets/img/blog/2024inreview/mummy.png"><br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>Movie (That I saw) of the Year</h2>
<p>
Deadpool & Wolverine<br/>
Yes, I know it's a Marvel movie. To be real I don't really give a toss about Marvel these days, but I really like Deadpool's crass and cynical sense of humor and the over-the-top violence.<br/>
Still too heterosexual.<br/>
<img width="768px" src="/assets/img/blog/2024inreview/deadpool.png"><br/>
Gubernatorial.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>Nintendo Lawsuit of the Year</h2>
<p>
Nintendo of America Inc. v. Tropic Haze LLC<br/>
The lawsuit that killed the Yuzu and Citra emulators, since Nintendo is gearing up to release the Nintendo Switch 2. Whether or not the Yuzu developers are at fault here is up for debate, but that doesn't mean that Nintendo's lawsuit wasn't totally full of crap. They just knew that nobody on that team could fight back since they have infinite money.<br/>
<img width="768px" src="/assets/img/blog/2024inreview/haze.png"><br/><br/>

Honorable mentions:<br/>
- Nintendo Co, Ltd. v. Pocketpair, Inc.<br/>
- Nintendo of America Inc. v. Keighin (this one's a real banger)<br/>
