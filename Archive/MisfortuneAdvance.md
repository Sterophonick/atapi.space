<h1>Misfortune Advance</h1>
<h3>A decent conversion of Misfortune.GB to the Game Boy Advance</h3> <br />
<p>the port of misfortune to the PC was decent, but i wanted it on an actual Game Boy.</p><br />
<p>I think I did OK on it, but i made it like 2 years ago, and it definitely could be improved on.</p>
